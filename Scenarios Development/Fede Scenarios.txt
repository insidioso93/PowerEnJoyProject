1. 

- Mario is in the centre of Milan, he needs an immediate transport for surfing the city for his commissions. Hence he decides to book a car through the PowerEnJoy service. While he is walking he looks to his mobile for discovering the nearest car offers by the company.

- Mario finds the car, indexes it to the company by the mobile and finally enter in it.

- Mario switches on the engine, a voice welcomes him by a greeting, by giving the coordinates of the current position and by hinting the current fee to pay at the end of the journey. Mario starts driving the car into the city.

2. 

(Second scenario or the Continuation ?)

- Mario (or another user) is driving inside the city. He can keep under control the amount of fee to pay by glancing the screen on the front. (There can be a function that states if the driver could stop for sometime the car for some reasons and coming back after a while within the same utilization?). 

-  commissions for Mario are too long and he has to use the car for some hours more than he has expected. The screen continues to increase the amount of money to pay currently.

- When he finishes the travel he simply parks the car in one position and through a particular function on the screen he indicates the end of the service. Unfortunately he left the car with more than 80% of the battery empty. The system readily detects it but Mario is hurried. As a result he has to pay 30% more on that last ride.

(Another scenario?)

- Luigi and two friends long to spend some time together driving on the hills and taking some fotos of the countryside. While they still are in the village they control they're electronical devices to find a PowerEnJoy car, finally they find one of them. 

- They send the request for the utilization and, supposing of a correct instance for this problem, after get on the trasport, the system instantly indentifies by its sensor that there are two more passengers, this brings the discount of 10%. 

- As long as the notification appears on the screen, the three friends begin their contryside exploration driving outside the village.

- Afterwhile they are in a city bigger than the first one. At this point they want to visit a little bit the city by foot. They park the car in a certain position and stop the service for the current utilization.

- The system checks the position in which the friends parked the car. The system detects that the car is left (less?) than three kilometers from the nearest and only power grid station in the city. Luigi is advised of the extrapayment of the 30% he has to afford for the lack.
