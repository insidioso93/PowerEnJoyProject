Purpose and Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is the Integration Testing Plan for the PoweEnJoy system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PowerEnJoy system
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the set of all the software artifacts (developed or bought) that
 cooperates in order to provide all the functionalities which are specified
 in the RASD document describing the PowerEnJoy services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this document is to outline, in a clear and comprehensive
 way, the main aspects concerning the organization of the integration testing
 activity for all the components that make up the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following section we are going to provide:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An exhaustive description of the integration process that we intend to follow
 with respect to the architecture that has been proposed in previous documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A description of the integration testing approach and the rationale behind
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A description of the test cases and test suites that we intend to perform
 on the main interfaces and modules interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A description of the main perfomance evaluation that we want to perform
 against the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A list of tools that we are going to use to perform the whole Verification
 & Validation analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to remark the fact that the Integration Testing Plan is intimatel
y connected with the Build Plan (or Integration Plan): the effective development
 of components and interfaces will be guided mainly by the criteria defined
 for the Integration Testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end, the idea is to follow the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

develop and test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approach, applied not only to software units but also to entire subsystems.

\begin_layout Subsection
Entry Criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the beginning of the Integration Testing some criteria have to be
 satisfied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
(in pratica sto dicendo che: ogni componente deve essere già ben definita,
 il sistema rispetto all'ambiente deve avere 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

confini
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 che non saranno piu modificati, le interfacce tra le varie componenti e
 per l'utente devono essere gia ben definite, deve esserci una documentazione
 parziale per poter capire qual è eventualmente l'errore e che il white
 box test deve essere fatto (quello per gli errori strutturali, mi è sembrato
 buono aggiungerlo perche l'ho trovato gia specificato in un documento e
 poi ricordo che va fatto comunque prima rispetto a questo tipo di test)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every logical and functional component of the System is well defined and
 well connected with each other.
 In particular, the interactions among entities presented in the Architecture
 Schema and in the Sequence Diagrams are in their final version, as well
 as correctly implemented through the specify tools (see the Design Document).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The edges of the System with respect to the remaining part of the Environment
 are well defined: there is nothing more to add to the System in terms of
 functionalities and there is nothing less to subtract to it (see requirements
 and goals in the RASD).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every interface, among entities and regarding the interaction with the User,
 is defined and in a util version for the next test analysis.
 In other words, it is not yet necessary a final implementation in this
 case, but it has to be clear how the transictions works and what precisely
 the User can receive and send via the particular interface (for instance
 the case of the Mobile App and the On Board System).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In addition to the inputs to give to the System by the Integration Test,
 it is not less important to have a clear view of what every functional
 part does within the System (with a non final, but still well detailed
 documentation for each important component of the functional part object
 of study).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Referring to the point above, the White Box Test has to be done for all
 the functional parts already implemented and analized in the Design Document
 and in the RASD previously.
 This means that, referring to the software components of the System described
 in the Design Document especially, all the portions of code regarding the
 UserController, the PaymentManager, the AdministrationHelper and the CarControl
ler were correctly and rationally deconstructed and eventually rewritten
 in some of their parts, for avoiding unreachable lines of code and typical
 conceptual errors.
 The BusinessManager is analyzed in the same way, paying a particular attention
 to the single links with the other components inside the whole schema (in
 general testing the links among logic units is important for their influences
 to themselves).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Elements to be integrated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(identify the components to be integrated, refer to your design document
 to identify such components in a way that is consistent with your design)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

(in pratica in questa sezione vanno brevemente elencati con una breve spiegazion
e tutti i componenti che vengono utilizzati nella sessione 2.4 e eventualmente
 nel DD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Integration Testing Strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(describe the integration testing approach (top-down, bottom-up, functional
 groupings etc.) and the rationale for choosing that approach)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
(io pensavo alla bottom up e alla functional grouping perché col primo si
 testano le unità singolarmente e col secondo si raggruppano le unità fino
 ad arrivare in cima, le unità a cui ci si riferisce sono quelle del 2.4
 pero se avete idee migliori meglio capirle cosi le cose del 2.4 si fanno
 in base a questo tipo di scelta)

S1 User Interactions Subsystems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this section the subsystems related to all the User's aspects towards
 the System will be analyzed.
 A particular attention for all the relevant inputs of the User is the guideline
 to cover appropriately all the Test Cases.
 Every division of the section is referred to a particular situation between
 the entities, the references to the various situations are located in the
 Sequence Diagrams paragraph in the DD document and the various Scenarios,
 previously showed up in the RASD document.

S2 Interaction with the Payment Subsystem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This section wants to provide a better and brief description of how the
 System manages the different interactions with the Payment System (if you
 need a better description of the nature of it, you can refer to the RASD
 and the DD documents).
 The System, in particular, has to build a precise instance of an object
 with some inputs statements whose correctness in the form has to be clear
 to the Transactional System.
 On the other way, it will be the Transactional System to return typed values
 from the corresponding function calls that the System can understand and
 correcly handle for next steps of the operations.
 This concepts have to be clear indipendently from the implementation details
 and all the exceptions in the middle has to be managed by the System.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The actions of the Users for the different scenarios are stated inside a
 log file, the test regards checking if the actions are univoquely mapped
 inside it and updated with respect to the current date and time.
 This is important because in exceptional and common case the Administrator
 can always relies on this kind of documentation.
